# US Accidents Severity Prediction	

## Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

### Introduction 
Road accidents can be caused by a variety of meteorological and topographical factors, in addition to human mistake. Due to slick roadways, a 100-car pileup occurred recently. Road accidents are more likely under certain circumstances. Several research have been undertaken in order to acquire sufficient data on elements that may contribute to the likelihood of accidents. Nonetheless, "What are the major elements that cause road accidents?" and "How can we forecast them?" remain open questions. We propose analyzing a road accident data set collected in the United States from February 2016 to December 2021 in order to learn about the primary elements that cause accidents and maybe forecast them with a good accuracy.

### Dataset:
Accident dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

### Tools / Technologies:
Programming language: Python
Data science Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NLTK and
Scrapy
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab 

### Preprocessing 
The dataset includes 47 columns with severity as the output variable. This includes accidents data from 49 states. We have analysed the data and noticed that it has null values. We are planning to drop the null value columns or apply ffill or bfill methods and choose the best out of two. In preprocessing we have visualized accident data from all states. And also visualized top 10 accident states in US and top 10 accident cities in Us Analyzing accidents per year and per month.

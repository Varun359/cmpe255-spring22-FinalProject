### Introduction 
Road accidents can be caused by a variety of meteorological and topographical factors, in addition to human mistake. Due to slick roadways, a 100-car pileup occurred recently. Road accidents are more likely under certain circumstances. Several research have been undertaken in order to acquire sufficient data on elements that may contribute to the likelihood of accidents. Nonetheless, "What are the major elements that cause road accidents?" and "How can we forecast them?" remain open questions. We propose analyzing a road accident data set collected in the United States from February 2016 to December 2021 in order to learn about the primary elements that cause accidents and maybe forecast them with a good accuracy.
